## KaseiCoin / fungible token-ERC20

As a fintech profesional, by representing Martian Aerospace Agency. I created a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin on the blockchain technology. By creating a Crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
KaseiCoin is created on solidity, a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. Deployed with Remix IDE and tested with Ganache and MetaMask.

Project started by creating the KaseiCoin Token Contract as follows:

Created KaseiCoin crowdsale Contract

Created KaseiCoin Deployer contract

And finally I includ or extend the contract by adding OpenZeppelin contracts as shown in the image below

Because we add other contracts we have to adjust our variables and constractor accordingly

After compiling ower code successfully we deploy the contracts to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
